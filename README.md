# ConsensusKit

The consensus problem requires agreement among a number of processes (or agents) for a single data value. Some of the processes (agents) may fail or be unreliable in other ways, so consensus protocols must be fault tolerant or resilient. The processes must somehow put forth their candidate values, communicate with one another, and agree on a single consensus value.

A consensus protocol must satisfy the following:

**Termination**
* Eventually, every correct process decides some value.

**Integrity**
* If all the correct processes proposed the same value *v*, then any correct process must decide *v*.

**Agreement**
* Every correct process must agree on the same value.

In this repository you can find implementations for the following algorithms:
